# What is Extra Life?

Extra Life unites thousands of gamers around the world to play games in support of their local [Children's Miracle Network Hospital](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/). Since its inception in 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $40 million for sick and injured kids. Sign up today and dedicate a day of play for kids in your community!

# Extra Life at Michigan Tech

Extra Life at Michigan Tech is not your standard 24 hour gaming marathon. At this 6 hour event, we've chosen to create a unique and exciting gaming environment where you can have fun and hang out with your fellow Huskies. Attendee's are encouraged to bring their own games, consoles, and even computers. Some games and consoles will be provided by Triangle Fraternity Brothers and other organizations for open play. In support of [Children's Miracle Network Hospitals](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/), please consider donating at our event or on our [fundraising page](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/MTU_Extra_Life).
