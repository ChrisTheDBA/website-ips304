This site is built using open source! 

<!-- excerpt -->

Over the past year, I have been learning how to build new and crisp websitesusing Bootstrap 4 and GitHub Pages. I decided to migrate to GitHub Pages and away from a privately hoste'ved WordPress website for robustness, maintainability, and the learning opportunities that is provides. I learned that WordPress is a nice framework, if you're willing to put in the work into designing and maintaining it in the future.

So even though a website on GitHub Pages can also take fair amount of effort, there are a number of frameworks that can make things easy. This site, as well as many others, uses a framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This "blog aware" framework allows us to create a easy to use website, and allows future members to write create Markdown files which get automatically generated into web pages. 

One of the things that a GitHub Pages website provides is traceability. By having the website version controlled on GitHub, I can track important changes to the website over time and never lose any history. Changes are required to be made by people with a GitHub account. Students might see this as a burden at first, but free for everyone, and students can even get added perks when signing up with their school email through the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) website.

One of the issues with previous websites was exactly what one would expect when a website is managed by two
different groups, the cohesion between different types of content and structure. This is another area where an open source website can greatly improve upon, openness and community building around a project or program. With an open source site on GitHub, both alumni members and active members can easily make changes to the website without any restrictions or fear of completely destroying some random server on the internet.
